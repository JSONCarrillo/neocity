# J's World
The source code to my neocities website jworld.neocities.org

## Why Neocities? 
After quitting pretty much every bit of social media, I wanted to create a space that I could make uniquely me. I liked the old-ways of MySpace and Geocities, and 
when I stumbled upon Neocities, I fell in love. So, this website allows me to really dive deep into web design and coding practices of 90's Web 1.0.

It has, by far, become one of my favorite coding projects. Despite it's lack of complexity, the beauty to me is in it's "dated" UI and GIFs.

## Features Coming Soon
 - Mood Board : Basically a collection of inspirations
 - Loungeroom : A place for people who are on the site presently to interact with other people who happen to be visiting at the same time
 - Jukebox : Music Player
 - Tech and Game Collection Pages : Basically a showcase of what currently is in my video game and technology collection. Remember it's not hoarding if it's organized ;)
 - Status Update : This will also have API connectivity for me to post real-time status updates from anywhere without having to manually go in and change the code
 - GAMES! : Hope to throw in a couple web games for people visiting to come and play. Maybe an Idle Clicker, or a tomogatchi-like game.
